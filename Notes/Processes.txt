What are processes?


Types of processes:
	1. Action
	2. Business Process flow 
	3. Workflows - widely used in projects 
	4. Power Automate (Flow)
	
These are classsic processes within CDS 

Workflow processes:
	series of steps and rules that help to automate a business process without user interface.
	works in background.
	usually triggered as a event.
	Each workflow process is associated with single entity (trigger) 
		e.g., Sending email when a contact record is created  by the user 
			Trigger Entity- Contact
			Event - Create of contact 
Workflows can be intiated in 2 ways :
1. Manual
2. Automatic 

Points to consider while creating workflows :
	1. when to start 
	2. should run as realtime or background workflow.
	3. what actions to perform
	4. what conditions should actions be performed.
Steps to create workflow process:
	1. switch to classic 
	2. components -> processes 
	3. Category as workflow and select the right entity 

		Background workflows (Asynchronous)  -> default 
		Realtime workflows (Synchronous)
Background workflow is taken by a different process, because of it we have to reload the page to check the task assigned.
Realtime workflow gives immediate task assigned results 

Run as on demand process :
	open account -> settings -> flow -> run workflow 
	If On demand workflow is checked then we can trigger workflow manually using above navigation 
		
Troubleshooting workflow logs :
	App -> Settings -> Advanced Settings -> System jobs 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Generating Email to manger when the record is created :

Workflow steps :
	1. in send email task select the to option dynamically 
		entity as -> owning user -> which the owner of the current record 
					and accessing attribute as manager 

we can also send emails via 					
Microsoft flow or Microsoft Power automate 		
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Auto populate workflow :

		Example - A workflow that populates Approval date automatically when the record is approved by the manager.
		Set approval date to the timestamp of the current date and time of record approval.
		access timestamp from "Modified on" attribute of the expense request record. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wait condition - 
	Stopping the execution until the condition is satisfied :
		statement 1;
		wait(condition)
		{ statement 2;
		}
		statement 3;
wait condition scenario :
	
		Trigger on account create 
			1. create task 1
			2. wait until task 1 is completed 
			3. then create task 2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time out condition :
Time out is a variation of wait condition 
		statement 1;
		Timeout(duration)
		{ statement 2;
		}
		statement 3;
usage :
	1. To send reminder emails 
	2. To escalate to managers 
Assume that expense request has to be approved/rejected within 5 days 
Send a reminder email to manager after 4 days.

the above scenarios can be achieved by editing the existing workflow -> send rmail to manager after submission 
	add step as wait -> select condition as process -> timeout -> equals -> 4 days condition

Business Process Flow : BPF 
BPF is useful when we have 100 of attributes and customer dont know what to do.. just to remind them what they have to do in each stage 
	Contains series of stages
	each stage has steps 
1. Qualify
2. Develop 
3. Propose 
4. close 

For example : Expense Request Entity 
	1. Data Capture 
	2. Review 
	3. Approval 
Workflow and action step in BPF -> we can trigger on demand workflows and actions in BPF
