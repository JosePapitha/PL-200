Security Model 
--------------------------
1. Security Roles - sales /marketing and restrict data according to the roles 
		e.g., user can add and view the record, manager can delete the record 
2. Users can share data without giving ownership 

user management is done at -> Microsoft 365 level with help of Azure Active directory (AAD)
  In AAD -> authentication happens 
	Logging into CRM, credentials will be validated against AAD (add/remove users, forget passwords)
  
Adding users - User Management . Billing and purchases 
This is will be done by company infrastructure teams 
	admin.microsoft.com
	adding users to dynamics 365/ Power apps
	
Steps to create new users :
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. admin.microsoft.com -> users -> add users -> pick license 
2. Make sure users are added in correct business unit in the application 
3. provide security roles 
4. provide app access make.powerapps.com  - select Expense app -> share and add the user and share it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------	
common data service roles:
	UI -> users -> select users -> settings -> advanced settings -> Security -> users 
	Check users in enabled users 
	or 
	admin.powerplatform.com -> environment -> settings -> users 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ownership :
	user can change the ownership by using assign button 
	Select the users from enabled users -> Manage roles ( roles for power apps ) -> assign some roles 
	
	For custom entities -> we have an option to not to give the owner 
		new entity -> advanced settings -> entity type and ownership 
			1. user or team -> owner field is automatically added 
			2. Organization -> no owner 
					e.g., metadata like -> office location 
						  Error codes 
----------------------------------------------
What are business units?
	Departments or companies.
	Created based on functions or geography
	new users must be assigned to business units before creating security roles.
	
Root BU  (organization)-> Child BU -> Child BU

BU created based on geography -> US or CA 

Steps to create BU:
	Power platform admin center -> Environment -> dynamicscrm -> settings -> Business unit 
	
	Select organization (Root BU) -> left (business unit) -> new business unit 
	
To add the BU to user :
	select user -> update BU 
---------------------------------------------------
Security Roles :
1. contains set of permissions - create,update,read and delete 
2. users assigned to security roles get all permissions assigned to that roles
	e.g., sales manager role 
3. There are many existing roles in CDS , we can modify or create new ones 
4. Each users can have multiple security roles


Privileges :
1. Record level	-
	create, update, assign, delete, share 
2. Task level -
	print, email, add security roles 

Power platform admin center -> Environment -> dynamicscrm -> settings -> Security Roles 

Copy existing roles to create new one 
--------------
	Inside edit option within core records -> CDS core components are found
record level privileges -> For an entity 
Allows user to - 
		create - add
		read - view 
		write - edit 
		delete - remove 
		append - associate entities with a parent record 
		appendto - associate entities with the record 
		assign - giving ownership
		share - giving access 
Miscellaneous privileges -> task level 
------------------------------------
Level of acces :
	1. User 
	2. BU
	3. Parent child
	4. Organization
------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Demo of Security Role:

Root - owner - jose - account record (google)
child - US - owner - helen george - account record (Microsoft)
		     user A
		CA - user B 
Go to application -> settings -> users -> Helen george , check whether the BU is US 
Then , make.powerapps.com -> Apps -> Select Expense App -> click share and choose helen george -> CDS as Northwinfd sales manager 

change below and view with different logins --
Create - BU 
Read - None , BU, Org 
	
-------------------------
Northwind case study :

Security :

Employees -
	1. Can create expense request and items 
	2. Cannot change the status 
	3. cannot edit the expense request once submitted 
	4. Cannot delete any records 
	5. Can see their own records   ---> user access 

Managers -
	1. Can edit expense request and items 
	2. Can see all the records ---> organization access 
	3. Cannot delete records 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Sharing features :
	1. users can share their privileges with others 
	2. can be shared to different BU users too
Assign - change of ownership 
sharing - Sharing of privileges. No owner change.

select account with admin user and share the access.
----------------------------------------------------------
Team :
	collection of users with same or different business unit
	one user can belong to multiple teams 
Types of Team :
	1. Owner team 
	2. Azure active directory ( AD ) group team 
	3. Access team
	-------------------------------------------------------

Access teams :
1. Simplifies the sharing feature 
2. Defining permissions to share with a particular entity 
3. by adding subgrid of users in the entity 

Steps to create -
 1. enable the entity for access team 
	solutions -> entity -> settings -> more settings -> colloboration -> auto create access teams 
	
Account entity -> Security tab in form design 
	Read only access 
	Read write access 
Steps to remember while adding subgrid for access template :
	1. Records - all record types 
	2. Entity - users 
	3. Default view - associated record team members 
	4. read write access / read only access ---> access template created 
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Field level security :
	credit card info 
	ssn 
specific field level restrictions 

Field security profile :
	It is used to give access to fields that have been enabled for field level security to users other than default admin 

Solutions -> entity -> columns -> select a column -> advanced options -> enable column security 
	a icon will be inserted in the field -> save table 
---------------------
To enable field security profile :
	solutions -> expense management system -> new -> other -> column security profile 
-----------------
Hierarchy security :
	Advanced level of security 
	used in complex security requirements 
	brings maintainence cost down - coz works dynamically 
types :
	1. Manager hierarchy - lookups in main forms 
	must be within same BU 
					CEO
	 VP of sales     		 VP of service 
	sales Managers 				service managers 
	 sales people 				  service people 
steps to enable manager hierarchy :
	environment -> settings -> users -> hierarchy security -> Enable manager hierarchy
Immediate subordinates -> all the privileges except delete 
Non- immediate subordinates -> Only read access 
	2. Position hierarchy -> groups 
First enable hierarchy security
