Relationships :
	Relating records of entities to each other in same database
	
Types -
	1:N
	N:1
	N:N

(Account is       (Contact is number of employee
company detail)	      details associated with the company)

Creating Relationship record
Two of creating relationship record:
	1. Creating Lookup attribute inside Expense item entity
	
		always from Primary	to related entity -> 1:N
		  i.e., Expense request -> Expense Item
		  
		Go to relationships tab
			add relationship -> one to many
	2. Adding subgrid to the forms 
	
		Go to Forms
		adding subgrid to expense request
		add component
		
		forms in expense item 
		add expense request field
		
	Publish and in app add expense item in trip 1
	
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Relationship behaviour :

	Request record deleted -> what happens to related request item ?
	
	Types:
		Referential (default) - no cascading
		parental  - cascading
		custom
	Delete function - Restrict 
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Mappings 
 can be achieved via classic UI
	Inside relationship -> mappings 
	create new mapping 
		primary entity -> related entity
		Mapping can be done only in 1:N and N:1 
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Connection Roles:
	without relationship -> connecting entity
	connections supplement relationships
	
	Relationship drawbacks:
		Account -> contact
			relationship cannot say which contact is associated with account 
				eg., former employee, customer , supplier
				i.e., roles are not clearly known
	Insurance Policy
	p
	contacts - A,B,C,D
	
	connection roles says A is child of B
						  B is parent of A
						  C is primary policy contact
						  D is nominee
